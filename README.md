## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the live application, follow these steps to securely connect your data.

### 1. Secure Google Sheets Authorization

1.  Navigate to the **Connect & Analyze** tab.
2.  Click **"Authorize Google Sheets"** to begin the OAuth flow.
3.  You may see the **"Google hasn't verified this app"** warning. This is expected for hobby projects. To proceed:
    * Click **`Advanced`**.
    * Click **`Go to dab-ai-automailreporting.onrender.com (unsafe)`**.
4.  Grant the necessary read-only permission for Google Sheets. You will be redirected back upon success.
5.  Paste your Google Sheet URL into the input field to load your data (e.g., *1,000 rows loaded*).

### 2. Generate Your Report

1.  After data preview is successful, click the **`Generate AI Analysis`** button.
2.  The application will display the multi-section report in real-time.
3.  Click **`Generate Charts`** to append automated visualizations (EDA) to the analysis.

### 3. Setup Automation

1.  Switch to the **Schedule Reports** tab.
2.  Set the **Recipient Email**, **Job Name**, and **Frequency** (e.g., Daily/Weekly).
3.  Select your desired **Report Language**.
4.  Ensure **`Auto-refresh data`** is checked.
5.  Click **`Schedule Report`** to activate the automated job. You can monitor its status in the **Jobs** tab.

## 🔒 Privacy Assurance

This application is designed with user privacy as a priority:

* **Stateless Processing:** Data is only read when a report is generated or scheduled. It is immediately discarded after the analysis is complete. **Your data is never persisted on DaB.AI servers.**
* **Read-Only Scope:** The application only requests permission to **read** the data from the Google Sheet you specify. It cannot modify or delete your files.
